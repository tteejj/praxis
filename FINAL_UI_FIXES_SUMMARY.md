# Final UI Fixes Summary

## All Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Dialog Not Clearing on ESC
**Problem**: When pressing ESC to close a dialog, the dialog remnants remained on screen
**Solution**: 
- Modified `ScreenManager.Render()` to clear screen when `_lastContent` is empty
- Added `Invalidate()` call in `ScreenManager.Pop()` to force redraw of underlying screen
- Properly stores content for comparison to detect major changes

### 2. ✅ TextBox Borders Fixed
**Problem**: TextBox borders had broken corners (╭ and ╰ not connecting properly)
**Solution**:
- Updated all dialog positioning to use height=3 instead of 2 for MinimalTextBox
- Fixed NewProjectDialog: All textboxes now use proper 3-line height
- Fixed EditProjectDialog: All textboxes now use proper 3-line height
- Increased dialog heights to accommodate the correct textbox heights

### 3. ✅ Main Screen Borders Now Single Rounded Lines
**Problem**: Borders were inconsistent, not rounded everywhere, not single lines
**Solution**:
- MainScreen now draws a single rounded border around the entire application
- TabContainer positioned with 1-pixel inset to fit inside the border
- TabContainer separator line connects with main border using junction characters (├ and ┤)
- Disabled individual component borders (ProjectGrid, TaskGrid) to avoid double borders

### 4. ✅ Borders Go Around Whole Screen
**Problem**: Borders didn't encompass the entire screen area
**Solution**:
- MainScreen.OnRender() draws BorderType.Rounded around full screen bounds (0,0,Width,Height)
- All content positioned inside this border with proper insets
- Consistent single-line rounded border throughout

### 5. ✅ All Dialog Issues Fixed
**User Complaint**: "WHAT ABOUT E D OR ANYTING ELSE????"
**Solution**:
- EditTaskDialog converted from Screen to BaseDialog base class
- All dialogs now properly extend BaseDialog
- All keyboard shortcuts verified to work without VT method errors:
  - Projects: N (New), E (Edit), D (Delete) ✓
  - Tasks: N (New), E (Edit), D (Delete), Shift+A (Subtask) ✓
- All dialogs support Tab navigation between fields
- All textboxes in dialogs have rounded borders

## Visual Improvements Achieved

1. **Consistent Borders**: Single-line rounded borders everywhere as requested
2. **Clean Dialog Rendering**: Dialogs properly clear when closed
3. **Proper TextBox Display**: All textboxes show complete rounded borders
4. **Full Screen Border**: Application has a professional border encompassing all content
5. **Tab Bar Integration**: Tab separator connects cleanly with main border

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files:
- `/Core/ScreenManager.ps1`: Added screen clearing on major content changes
- `/Screens/MainScreen.ps1`: Added OnRender override to draw main border
- `/Components/TabContainer.ps1`: Added junction characters to separator line
- `/Screens/ProjectsScreen.ps1`: Disabled individual grid border
- `/Screens/TaskScreen.ps1`: Disabled individual grid border
- `/Screens/NewProjectDialog.ps1`: Fixed textbox heights and dialog size
- `/Screens/EditProjectDialog.ps1`: Fixed textbox heights and dialog size
- `/Screens/EditTaskDialog.ps1`: Converted to extend BaseDialog
- `/Components/MinimalListBox.ps1`: Added BorderType property for consistency

### Key Patterns Established:
- Main application container draws the outer border
- Individual components don't draw borders unless specifically needed
- All dialogs extend BaseDialog for consistent behavior
- TextBoxes always use height=3 to accommodate borders
- Tab navigation works consistently across all dialogs
