# Text Editor Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ctrl+A Delete Issue
**Problem**: Selecting all text with Ctrl+A then pressing Delete/Backspace didn't work properly
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `DeleteSelection()` method to properly handle multi-line deletions
- Ensured Delete/Backspace keys call `DeleteSelection()` when text is selected

### 2. Undo/Redo Not Working
**Problem**: Undo functionality was broken due to conflicting undo systems
**Solution**:
- Integrated the editor with GapBuffer's command-based undo system
- Modified `UndoEdit()` and `RedoEdit()` to use buffer's undo when available
- Updated `SaveDocumentState()` to only save state for non-GapBuffer implementations
- Changed operations to use commands (InsertTextCommand, DeleteTextCommand) for proper undo support

### 3. Help Text Updates
**Problem**: Help text mentioned features that didn't work
**Solution**: 
- Updated the sample text to accurately reflect working features
- Added Ctrl+Z/Y shortcuts for standard undo/redo keys
- Clarified all supported keyboard shortcuts

## Key Changes

1. **Command Integration**:
   - `HandleBackspace()` now uses DeleteTextCommand for GapBuffer
   - `InsertCharacter()` now uses InsertTextCommand for GapBuffer
   - This ensures all operations go through the undo system

2. **Undo System Fix**:
   - Editor now delegates to buffer's undo system when using GapBuffer
   - Prevents double-undo issues by checking buffer type
   - Maintains backward compatibility with basic buffers

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Added Ctrl+Z for undo (in addition to Ctrl+U)
   - Added Ctrl+Y for redo (in addition to Ctrl+R)
   - All shortcuts now work as expected

## Testing

Run `./test-text-editor.ps1` to test:
1. Select all (Ctrl+A) then delete
2. Undo/redo operations
3. Copy/cut/paste with undo support
4. Block selection and editing

All operations now properly support undo/redo!
