# Focus and Border Fix Summary

## Focus Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ BaseDialog Tab Navigation Fixed
**Problem**: BaseDialog had its own manual Tab handling that conflicted with FocusManager
**Solution**: Updated BaseDialog.HandleInput() to use FocusManager for Tab navigation
```powershell
# Now uses:
$focusManager.FocusNext($this)  # or FocusPrevious
```

### 2. ✅ Component Registration Working
**Verification**: UIElement.AddChild() already calls Initialize() which registers with FocusManager
**Code Path**:
- AddChild() → child.Initialize() → FocusManager.RegisterFocusable()

### 3. ✅ Dialog Components Updated
All dialogs now use MinimalTextBox and MinimalButton:
- QuickTimeEntryDialog ✓
- TimeEntryDialog ✓
- FindReplaceDialog ✓
- CommandEditDialog ✓

## Border Alignment Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dialog Height Calculations
**Problem**: NewProjectDialog had 9 textboxes (27 lines) but DialogHeight=30
**Solution**: Increased DialogHeight to 36 to accommodate all controls

### 2. Remaining Border Issues to Check
- TaskScreen status bar may overlap with MainScreen border
- Dialog borders may not align perfectly with rounded corners

## Testing Focus Navigation

To verify focus is working:
1. Open any dialog (press N in Projects or Tasks screen)
2. Press Tab - focus should move between textboxes
3. Press Shift+Tab - focus should move backwards
4. Press Enter on a button - it should activate

## Known Issues Still to Fix

1. **Dialog Border Alignment**: Some dialogs may have borders that don't align perfectly
2. **TaskScreen Status Bar**: May overlap with main border at bottom
3. **Focus Visibility**: Some components may not show clear focus indicators

## Next Steps

1. Test Tab navigation in all dialogs
2. Verify all textboxes show rounded borders correctly
3. Check that status bars don't overlap main borders
4. Ensure focus indicators are visible on all focusable components
