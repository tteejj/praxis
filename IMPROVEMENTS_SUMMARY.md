# PRAXIS Framework Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the PRAXIS TUI framework to enhance consistency, maintainability, and architectural integrity.

## High Priority Issues Fixed

### 1. FastFileTree Component Refactoring ✅
**Problem**: Component was partially refactored with inconsistent patterns
**Solution**: 
- Changed `Initialize()` to `OnInitialize()` to follow PRAXIS patterns
- Removed duplicate caching logic (`_cachedRender` field)
- Fixed ServiceContainer usage (removed `$global:Logger` references)
- Made StringBuilderPool usage more robust with fallbacks
- Removed incomplete helper methods

### 2. Focus Handling Standardization ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent focus handling across screens
**Solutions**:
- **TaskScreen**: Changed `HandleInput` to `HandleScreenInput`
- **SettingsScreen**: 
  - Removed unnecessary `HandleInput` override
  - Removed manual `FocusNext()` method
  - Removed manual left/right arrow focus switching
- **DashboardScreen**: 
  - Changed `HandleInput` to `HandleScreenInput`
  - Removed manual `CycleFocus()` method
  - Added `OnActivated()` to set initial focus

**Pattern**: All screens now follow the parent-delegated focus model where:
- Screens use `HandleScreenInput()` for keyboard shortcuts
- Tab navigation is handled automatically by the framework
- Initial focus is set in `OnActivated()`
- No manual focus cycling

### 3. Dialog Consistency ✅
**Problem**: Some dialogs didn't use BaseDialog class
**Solutions**:
- **ConfirmationDialog**: Refactored to inherit from `BaseDialog`, maintains Y/N shortcuts
- **SubtaskDialog**: Refactored to use `BaseDialog`, maintains all functionality
- **TimeEntryDialog**: Already using `BaseDialog` (no changes needed)

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 4. ShortcutManager Service ✅
**Problem**: Keyboard shortcuts were hardcoded throughout components
**Solution**: Created centralized `ShortcutManager` service
- Supports global, screen-specific, and context-specific shortcuts
- Priority-based shortcut resolution
- Dynamic shortcut registration/unregistration
- Integration with EventBus for shortcut events
- Shortcut discovery and help generation

**Benefits**:
- Centralized shortcut management
- Easy to add/modify shortcuts
- Potential for user customization
- Better documentation of available shortcuts

### 5. Global Variable Cleanup ✅
**Problem**: Redundant global variables alongside service container
**Solution**: 
- Removed `$global:StateManager` (redundant with service container)
- Kept justified globals:
  - `$global:ServiceContainer` - needed for bootstrapping
  - `$global:Logger` - performance optimization for high-frequency calls
  - `$global:ScreenManager` - convenience for navigation
  - `$global:PraxisRoot` - configuration value
  - `$global:PraxisDebug` - debug flag

## Architecture Principles Reinforced

1. **Parent-Delegated Input Model**: Input flows from ScreenManager → Screen → Container → Components
2. **Service Container Pattern**: Dependencies injected through ServiceContainer
3. **Performance First**: String-based rendering, caching, minimal allocations
4. **PowerShell Idioms**: Working with PowerShell patterns, not against them

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify improvements:
- `test-shortcut-manager.ps1` - Tests ShortcutManager functionality

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **When creating new screens**:
   - Inherit from `Screen` base class
   - Use `HandleScreenInput()` for shortcuts
   - Set initial focus in `OnActivated()`
   - Register shortcuts with ShortcutManager in `OnInitialize()`

2. **When creating new dialogs**:
   - Inherit from `BaseDialog`
   - Override `InitializeContent()` for dialog-specific controls
   - Use `AddContentControl()` to add controls with proper tab order

3. **When adding shortcuts**:
   - Register with ShortcutManager instead of hardcoding
   - Use appropriate scope (Global, Screen, Context)
   - Provide clear names and descriptions

The framework now has consistent patterns across all components while maintaining its performance-focused design goals.
