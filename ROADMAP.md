# PRAXIS Development Roadmap

## Development Approach: Build & Remodel
We're following an agile "build & remodel" pattern:
- **Build features** with current patterns (callbacks, scriptblocks)
- **Deliver working functionality** quickly
- **Refactor gradually** as foundation pieces (EventBus, etc.) are added
- **Learn from usage** what the framework really needs

This approach means some components may need updates when core systems like EventBus are implemented, but we get a working application sooner and can validate our architectural decisions through real use.

## Current Status
PRAXIS is a hybrid TUI framework combining:
- **Architecture from AxiomPhoenix**: Service-based DI, component hierarchy, theming

    - Fixed all dialog button initialization (missing ServiceContainer)
    - Fixed button text rendering (integer division and caching issues)
    - Fixed dialog positioning (moved to OnBoundsChanged)
    - Fixed DataGrid negative width calculations
    - Applied consistent dark overlay rendering to all dialogs

12. **ListBox OnSelectionChanged** (2025-07-22)
    - Added OnSelectionChanged callback property to ListBox
    - Follows same pattern as Button.OnClick
    - Updated SettingsScreen to use callback instead of manual tracking
    - Removed ~15 lines of workaround code

13. **Dialog Components Completed** (2025-07-22)
    - **EditProjectDialog**: Full project editing with name, nickname, notes, and due date
    - **TextInputDialog**: Generic text input with customizable prompt and default value
    - **NumberInputDialog**: Numeric input with validation, min/max constraints, and decimal support
    - All dialogs follow consistent patterns: dark overlay, centered layout, proper button positioning

14. **Task Edit Fix & Command Palette Updates** (2025-07-22)
    - Fixed Task model property mismatch: changed `ModifiedAt` to `UpdatedAt` in TaskScreen
    - Added edit/delete commands to CommandPalette for both projects and tasks
    - Commands automatically switch to appropriate tab before executing
    - All CRUD operations now accessible via command palette (`/` or `:`)

15. **üéâ EventBus System Implementation** (2025-07-22)
    - **Complete publish/subscribe event system** for decoupled component communication
    - **Event-driven architecture** replacing direct parent/child references and callbacks
    - **Dynamic command registration** - screens can register commands at runtime
    - **Cross-screen communication** - components notify each other via events
    - **ThemeManager integration** - theme changes now use EventBus while maintaining backward compatibility
    - **Dialog lifecycle events** - dialogs publish open/close events for monitoring
    - **Comprehensive event types** - 20+ standardized event names for consistency
    - **EventBus monitor tool** - built-in debugging UI accessible via command palette
    - **Event history and debugging** - optional event logging and statistics
    - **Backward compatibility** - all existing callback patterns still work
    - **Documentation** - complete EventBus.md with patterns, examples, and migration guide

16. **üîÑ Input System Refactor** (2025-07-22)
    - **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: Replaced complex service-based input handling with simple, direct patterns
    - **Removed broken services**: ShortcutManager and FocusManager caused method invocation errors and context loss
    - **ScreenManager direct global shortcuts**: `/`, `:`, Tab, Ctrl+Q handled at top level for reliability
    - **Screen.FocusNext() method**: Simple, fast focus navigation shared by all screens - no complex caching
    - **UIElement.Focus() simplified**: Direct focus management with tree traversal - no WeakReferences or services
    - **Dialog HandleInput() methods**: Direct key handling in dialogs - no scriptblock context issues
    - **PowerShell-native patterns**: Works WITH PowerShell object model instead of fighting it
    - **Speed optimized**: No service lookups in hot paths, direct method calls, minimal allocations
    - **Reliability improved**: Tab works everywhere, Escape works in dialogs, no more "method not found" errors

17. **üéØ Critical Input Routing Fix** (2025-07-22)
    - **DISCOVERED**: TabContainer was not routing input to active tab content screens
    - **ROOT CAUSE**: TabContainer inherited from Container and used Container.HandleInput() which routed to TabContainer's "children" (tab headers), not tab content
    - **INPUT FLOW TRACED**: MainScreen ‚Üí TabContainer ‚Üí Container.HandleInput() ‚Üí ListBox (bypassed ProjectsScreen entirely!)
    - **SOLUTION**: Modified TabContainer.HandleInput() to route directly to active tab's content: `activeTab.Content.HandleInput(key)`
    - **PATTERN ESTABLISHED**: Screen-level shortcuts (e, d, n, r) are handled BEFORE passing to child components
    - **DEBUGGING METHOD**: Used logs to trace exact input flow - `grep -a "Key pressed: E" praxis.log` revealed the routing path
    - **CONSTRUCTOR BUG FIXED**: ProjectsScreen DeleteProject() was passing 2 args to ConfirmationDialog constructor (only accepts 1)

18. **üèóÔ∏è Layout System Implementation** (2025-07-22)
    - **DESIGNED**: PRAXIS layout system based on AxiomPhoenix Panel patterns with ALCAR's fast string rendering
    - **HorizontalSplit**: Two-pane horizontal layout with configurable split ratio (10-90%), cached layout calculations
    - **VerticalSplit**: Two-pane vertical layout with configurable split ratio, optimized boundary updates
    - **GridPanel**: Multi-column grid layout with auto-sizing, configurable spacing, optional borders
    - **PERFORMANCE**: All layouts use cached calculations to avoid expensive re-calculations on every render
    - **STRING-BASED RENDERING**: Compatible with PRAXIS's fast VT100 string concatenation approach
    - **INPUT ROUTING**: Proper focus management and input routing to panes/cells
    - **HELPER METHODS**: Built-in methods for common split ratios (Equal, LeftFavored, etc.) and focus management
    - **TESTED**: Full integration test with complex nested layout (HorizontalSplit ‚Üí VerticalSplit ‚Üí GridPanel) successful

## ‚úÖ Major Issues Resolved (2025-07-22)
1. **"Method invocation failed because [ShortcutManager] does not contain a method named 'EditTask'"** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Scriptblock context loss in service-based shortcut system  
   - Solution: Direct method calls in screen HandleInput methods

2. **Tab navigation not working anywhere** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Complex service dependencies and scope management
   - Solution: Simple Screen.FocusNext() method with direct tree traversal

3. **Escape key not working in dialogs** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Service-based shortcut context not properly established
   - Solution: Direct HandleInput() methods in dialog classes

4. **Service over-engineering** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Fighting PowerShell's natural object model with complex service abstractions
   - Solution: Hybrid approach - global shortcuts in ScreenManager, screen-specific in HandleInput()

## üîß Current Technical Debt
Simplified after input system refactor:

1. **üö® INPUT FLOW ARCHITECTURE FLAW** (2025-07-23)
   - **ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Current pattern "Screen-level shortcuts handled BEFORE child components" breaks focused component interaction
   - **SYMPTOM**: New Project button press ‚Üí calls ViewProjectDetails() instead of NewProject() because Enter key intercepted by screen
   - **ROOT CAUSE**: Input priority order is backwards - screen shortcuts preempt focused buttons/textboxes
   - **CURRENT BROKEN FLOW**: ScreenManager ‚Üí Screen shortcuts ‚Üí Components (buttons never get their input!)
   - **CORRECT FLOW NEEDED**: ScreenManager (global only) ‚Üí Components (focused elements first) ‚Üí Screen (fallback only)
   - **IMPACT**: Violates basic UI expectations - focused elements should always get input priority
   - **SOLUTION**: Reverse HandleInput priority in screens to check focused children BEFORE screen shortcuts
   - **‚úÖ FIXED (2025-07-23)**: Applied corrected input flow to ProjectsScreen, BaseDialog, and ConfirmationDialog

2. **üé® THEME STANDARDIZATION** (2025-07-25)
   - **ISSUE**: Inconsistent theme key usage across components
   - **SYMPTOMS**: 
     - Some components use "title" while others use "dialog.title" or "accent" for titles
     - Missing theme keys like "title", "normal", "selected" caused rendering issues
     - Components cache theme colors differently, some not updating on theme change
   - **SPECIFIC PROBLEMS**:
     - CommandPalette uses "accent" for title instead of standardized "title" key
     - ListBox selection overflow - highlight extends beyond text to empty space
     - Theme change events not consistently refreshing all component caches
     - No standardized fallback pattern when theme keys are missing
   - **‚úÖ PARTIAL FIX (2025-07-25)**: 
     - Added missing keys to both default and matrix themes
     - Fixed list highlight overflow by clearing empty lines with background color
   - **TODO**:
     - Standardize all components to use consistent theme keys
     - Document theme key conventions in developer guide
     - Add theme validation to catch missing keys at runtime
     - Implement consistent cache invalidation on theme change
   
3. **üéØ PARENT-DELEGATED FOCUS MODEL** (2025-07-23)
   - **REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE**: Complete redesign of focus/input architecture
   - **OLD BROKEN MODEL**: Complex services (FocusManager/ShortcutManager) with weak references and context loss
   - **NEW MODEL**: Parent containers manage focus navigation for their children
   - **KEY PRINCIPLES**:
     - Tab key handled centrally by ScreenManager, finds focused element, asks its parent to navigate
     - Parents know their children's layout and decide next/previous focus target
     - No global focus list or complex caching - each container manages its own children
     - Infinite cycling: when reaching end, bubble up to parent until root, then wrap
   - **BENEFITS**:
     - Predictable: Parent always controls child navigation
     - Flexible: Different containers can implement different navigation patterns
     - Simple: No services, no weak references, no complex state
     - Fast: Direct method calls, no service lookups
   - **IMPLEMENTATION**:
     - ScreenManager.HandleTabNavigation() - finds focused element, delegates to parent
     - Container.FocusNextChild/FocusPreviousChild() - parent-specific navigation logic
     - Container.FocusFirstInTree/FocusLastInTree() - deep tree traversal for wrapping
     - Screen.IsFocusable = false - screens are containers, not focusable elements
   - **RESULTS**:
     - ‚úÖ Tab/Shift+Tab work everywhere with infinite cycling
     - ‚úÖ Ctrl+Left/Right work as alternative navigation
     - ‚úÖ Focus indicators show correctly (blue background)
     - ‚úÖ Initial focus set properly on screen activation
     - ‚úÖ No more focus-related crashes or context loss

3. **Direct Global Service Access**
   - Using $global:ServiceContainer directly
   - Should use proper injection patterns
   - Will improve with StateManager implementation

4. ~~**Manual Focus Management**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-07-22)**
   - ~~Each screen manually handles Tab navigation~~
   - ~~Should be centralized in a FocusManager~~
   - **Now handled by shared Screen.FocusNext() method - simple and reliable**

5. ~~**Command Registration**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-07-22)**
   - ~~Commands are manually added in CommandPalette initialization~~
   - ~~Should allow dynamic registration from screens/components~~
   - **EventBus now supports dynamic command registration via `[CommandRegistration]::RegisterCommand()`**

6. **Model Property Inconsistencies**
   - Task has UpdatedAt, Project has none
   - Should standardize timestamp properties across models
   - Consider base class for common properties

## üîß New Technical Debt (from EventBus Integration)
Items to address as the EventBus system matures:

1. **Mixed Event/Callback Patterns**
   - Components support both EventBus and legacy callbacks
   - Should gradually migrate all components to EventBus-only
   - Legacy support can be removed in future versions

2. **Event Type Safety**
   - Event data is passed as hashtables without type checking
   - Could benefit from strongly-typed event classes
   - EventNames constants help but don't enforce data structure

## üîÑ Migration Plan: Parent-Delegated Focus Model (2025-07-23)

### Components Already Updated
‚úÖ **Core Framework**:
- ScreenManager - HandleTabNavigation() method
- Container - FocusNextChild/FocusPreviousChild/FocusFirstInTree/FocusLastInTree
- Screen - IsFocusable = false, HandleInput delegates to Container first
- UIElement - Simplified Focus() method without services
- MainScreen - Proper HandleScreenInput for global shortcuts

‚úÖ **Updated Screens**:
- ProjectsScreen - Sets initial focus in OnActivated
- TabContainer - Routes input correctly to active content

### Components Requiring Migration

#### 1. **Dialogs with Legacy FocusNext()** (HIGH PRIORITY)
These dialogs still have manual FocusNext() methods that should be removed:
- [ ] EditTaskDialog - Remove FocusNext(), rely on Container navigation
- [ ] ConfirmationDialog - Remove FocusNext(), rely on Container navigation  
- [ ] TextInputDialog - Remove FocusNext(), rely on Container navigation
- [ ] NumberInputDialog - Remove FocusNext(), rely on Container navigation
- [ ] EditProjectDialog - Remove FocusNext(), ensure proper focus on open
- [ ] NewProjectDialog - Remove any manual focus handling
- [ ] NewTaskDialog - Remove any manual focus handling

**Migration Steps**:
1. Remove FocusNext() method
2. Remove Tab key binding  
3. Ensure dialog sets initial focus in OnActivated/OnShown
4. Let Container base class handle navigation

#### 2. **Screens with Manual Focus Handling** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] TaskScreen - Remove any FocusNext references
- [ ] SettingsScreen - Has custom FocusNext() that needs removal
- [ ] EventBusMonitor - Remove FocusNext() and Tab binding
- [ ] DashboardScreen - Verify no manual focus handling
- [ ] FileBrowserScreen - Update when implemented
- [ ] TextEditorScreen - Update when implemented

**Migration Steps**:
1. Override OnActivated() to set initial focus
2. Remove any HandleInput Tab handling
3. Ensure proper use of HandleScreenInput for shortcuts

#### 3. **Complex Layout Components** (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] HorizontalSplit - Verify FocusNextChild handles panes correctly
- [ ] VerticalSplit - Verify FocusNextChild handles panes correctly
- [ ] GridPanel - May need custom FocusNextChild for grid navigation
- [ ] DockPanel - May need custom navigation for docked regions

**Migration Steps**:
1. Override FocusNextChild/FocusPreviousChild if needed for custom navigation
2. Ensure proper child ordering for navigation

### Best Practices for New Components

1. **Never** make screens focusable (IsFocusable = false)
2. **Never** implement FocusNext() in components
3. **Always** set initial focus in OnActivated() for screens
4. **Always** let parent containers handle navigation
5. **Override** FocusNextChild only for custom navigation patterns

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Tab cycles through all focusable elements infinitely
- [ ] Shift+Tab reverses direction properly
- [ ] Ctrl+Left/Right work as alternatives
- [ ] Focus indicators show on all focusable elements
- [ ] Initial focus is set when screens activate
- [ ] No crashes when navigating
- [ ] Navigation works in nested containers

### üéØ Input Handling Best Practices (Established 2025-07-22)

**For Screen Classes** (Parent-Delegated Model):
```powershell
# In Screen base class - CORRECT PATTERN
[bool] HandleInput([System.ConsoleKeyInfo]$keyInfo) {
    # 1. Let focused child handle first (components get priority)
    $handled = ([Container]$this).HandleInput($keyInfo)
    if ($handled) {
        return $true
    }
    
    # 2. Screen shortcuts as fallback only
    return $this.HandleScreenInput($keyInfo)
}

# In derived screen - implement HandleScreenInput for shortcuts
[bool] HandleScreenInput([System.ConsoleKeyInfo]$keyInfo) {
    switch ($keyInfo.Key) {
        ([System.ConsoleKey]::N) {
            if (-not $keyInfo.Modifiers) {
                $this.NewItem()
                return $true
            }
        }
        # ... other screen-level shortcuts
    }
    return $false
}
```

**For Container Components** (like TabContainer):
- Route input to logical content, not just direct children
- Use `activeTab.Content.HandleInput(key)` instead of `([Container]$this).HandleInput(key)`

**Debugging Input Issues**:
- Use logs: `grep -a "Key pressed: [KEY]" _Logs/praxis.log`
- Trace the routing path: MainScreen ‚Üí TabContainer ‚Üí Screen ‚Üí Container ‚Üí Child
- Verify HandleInput methods are actually being called

## Next Immediate Steps
