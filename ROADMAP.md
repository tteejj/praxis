# PRAXIS Development Roadmap

## Development Approach: Build & Remodel
We're following an agile "build & remodel" pattern:
- **Build features** with current patterns (callbacks, scriptblocks)
- **Deliver working functionality** quickly
- **Refactor gradually** as foundation pieces (EventBus, etc.) are added
- **Learn from usage** what the framework really needs

This approach means some components may need updates when core systems like EventBus are implemented, but we get a working application sooner and can validate our architectural decisions through real use.

## Current Status
PRAXIS is a hybrid TUI framework combining:
- **Architecture from AxiomPhoenix**: Service-based DI, component hierarchy, theming
- **Speed from ALCAR**: Fast string-based rendering with cached VT100 sequences

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Core Framework**
   - Fast UIElement base class with render caching
   - Container system for layouts

   - ScreenManager for lifecycle and rendering
   - TabContainer for tab-based switching (1-9 shortcuts, Ctrl+Tab)
   - Screen base class with key bindings
   - Input handling chain fixed

3. **Basic Components**
   - ListBox with scrolling and selection

10. **SettingsScreen**
    - Visual settings management
    - Category-based organization
    - DataGrid for settings display
    - Reset functionality
    - Working around missing ListBox.OnSelectionChanged (will refactor when EventBus added)

11. **Dialog and Button Fixes** (2025-07-22)
    - Fixed ConfigurationService registration missing from Start.ps1
    - Fixed all dialog button initialization (missing ServiceContainer)
    - Fixed button text rendering (integer division and caching issues)
    - Fixed dialog positioning (moved to OnBoundsChanged)
    - Fixed DataGrid negative width calculations
    - Applied consistent dark overlay rendering to all dialogs

12. **ListBox OnSelectionChanged** (2025-07-22)
    - Added OnSelectionChanged callback property to ListBox
    - Follows same pattern as Button.OnClick
    - Updated SettingsScreen to use callback instead of manual tracking
    - Removed ~15 lines of workaround code

13. **Dialog Components Completed** (2025-07-22)
    - **EditProjectDialog**: Full project editing with name, nickname, notes, and due date
    - **TextInputDialog**: Generic text input with customizable prompt and default value
    - **NumberInputDialog**: Numeric input with validation, min/max constraints, and decimal support
    - All dialogs follow consistent patterns: dark overlay, centered layout, proper button positioning

14. **Task Edit Fix & Command Palette Updates** (2025-07-22)
    - Fixed Task model property mismatch: changed `ModifiedAt` to `UpdatedAt` in TaskScreen
    - Added edit/delete commands to CommandPalette for both projects and tasks
    - Commands automatically switch to appropriate tab before executing
    - All CRUD operations now accessible via command palette (`/` or `:`)

15. **üéâ EventBus System Implementation** (2025-07-22)
    - **Complete publish/subscribe event system** for decoupled component communication
    - **Event-driven architecture** replacing direct parent/child references and callbacks
    - **Dynamic command registration** - screens can register commands at runtime
    - **Cross-screen communication** - components notify each other via events
    - **ThemeManager integration** - theme changes now use EventBus while maintaining backward compatibility
    - **Dialog lifecycle events** - dialogs publish open/close events for monitoring
    - **Comprehensive event types** - 20+ standardized event names for consistency
    - **EventBus monitor tool** - built-in debugging UI accessible via command palette
    - **Event history and debugging** - optional event logging and statistics
    - **Backward compatibility** - all existing callback patterns still work
    - **Documentation** - complete EventBus.md with patterns, examples, and migration guide

16. **üîÑ Input System Refactor** (2025-07-22)
    - **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: Replaced complex service-based input handling with simple, direct patterns
    - **Removed broken services**: ShortcutManager and FocusManager caused method invocation errors and context loss
    - **ScreenManager direct global shortcuts**: `/`, `:`, Tab, Ctrl+Q handled at top level for reliability
    - **Screen.FocusNext() method**: Simple, fast focus navigation shared by all screens - no complex caching
    - **UIElement.Focus() simplified**: Direct focus management with tree traversal - no WeakReferences or services
    - **Dialog HandleInput() methods**: Direct key handling in dialogs - no scriptblock context issues
    - **PowerShell-native patterns**: Works WITH PowerShell object model instead of fighting it
    - **Speed optimized**: No service lookups in hot paths, direct method calls, minimal allocations
    - **Reliability improved**: Tab works everywhere, Escape works in dialogs, no more "method not found" errors

17. **üéØ Critical Input Routing Fix** (2025-07-22)
    - **DISCOVERED**: TabContainer was not routing input to active tab content screens
    - **ROOT CAUSE**: TabContainer inherited from Container and used Container.HandleInput() which routed to TabContainer's "children" (tab headers), not tab content
    - **INPUT FLOW TRACED**: MainScreen ‚Üí TabContainer ‚Üí Container.HandleInput() ‚Üí ListBox (bypassed ProjectsScreen entirely!)
    - **SOLUTION**: Modified TabContainer.HandleInput() to route directly to active tab's content: `activeTab.Content.HandleInput(key)`
    - **PATTERN ESTABLISHED**: Screen-level shortcuts (e, d, n, r) are handled BEFORE passing to child components
    - **DEBUGGING METHOD**: Used logs to trace exact input flow - `grep -a "Key pressed: E" praxis.log` revealed the routing path
    - **CONSTRUCTOR BUG FIXED**: ProjectsScreen DeleteProject() was passing 2 args to ConfirmationDialog constructor (only accepts 1)

18. **üèóÔ∏è Layout System Implementation** (2025-07-22)
    - **DESIGNED**: PRAXIS layout system based on AxiomPhoenix Panel patterns with ALCAR's fast string rendering
    - **HorizontalSplit**: Two-pane horizontal layout with configurable split ratio (10-90%), cached layout calculations
    - **VerticalSplit**: Two-pane vertical layout with configurable split ratio, optimized boundary updates
    - **GridPanel**: Multi-column grid layout with auto-sizing, configurable spacing, optional borders
    - **PERFORMANCE**: All layouts use cached calculations to avoid expensive re-calculations on every render
    - **STRING-BASED RENDERING**: Compatible with PRAXIS's fast VT100 string concatenation approach
    - **INPUT ROUTING**: Proper focus management and input routing to panes/cells
    - **HELPER METHODS**: Built-in methods for common split ratios (Equal, LeftFavored, etc.) and focus management
    - **TESTED**: Full integration test with complex nested layout (HorizontalSplit ‚Üí VerticalSplit ‚Üí GridPanel) successful

## ‚úÖ Major Issues Resolved (2025-07-22)
1. **"Method invocation failed because [ShortcutManager] does not contain a method named 'EditTask'"** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Scriptblock context loss in service-based shortcut system  
   - Solution: Direct method calls in screen HandleInput methods

2. **Tab navigation not working anywhere** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Complex service dependencies and scope management
   - Solution: Simple Screen.FocusNext() method with direct tree traversal

3. **Escape key not working in dialogs** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Service-based shortcut context not properly established
   - Solution: Direct HandleInput() methods in dialog classes

4. **Service over-engineering** - FIXED
   - Root cause: Fighting PowerShell's natural object model with complex service abstractions
   - Solution: Hybrid approach - global shortcuts in ScreenManager, screen-specific in HandleInput()

## üîß Current Technical Debt
Simplified after input system refactor:

1. **Direct Global Service Access**
   - Using $global:ServiceContainer directly
   - Should use proper injection patterns
   - Will improve with StateManager implementation

2. ~~**Manual Focus Management**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-07-22)**
   - ~~Each screen manually handles Tab navigation~~
   - ~~Should be centralized in a FocusManager~~
   - **Now handled by shared Screen.FocusNext() method - simple and reliable**

3. ~~**Command Registration**~~ ‚úÖ **RESOLVED (2025-07-22)**
   - ~~Commands are manually added in CommandPalette initialization~~
   - ~~Should allow dynamic registration from screens/components~~
   - **EventBus now supports dynamic command registration via `[CommandRegistration]::RegisterCommand()`**

4. **Model Property Inconsistencies**
   - Task has UpdatedAt, Project has none
   - Should standardize timestamp properties across models
   - Consider base class for common properties

## üîß New Technical Debt (from EventBus Integration)
Items to address as the EventBus system matures:

1. **Mixed Event/Callback Patterns**
   - Components support both EventBus and legacy callbacks
   - Should gradually migrate all components to EventBus-only
   - Legacy support can be removed in future versions

2. **Event Type Safety**
   - Event data is passed as hashtables without type checking
   - Could benefit from strongly-typed event classes
   - EventNames constants help but don't enforce data structure

## üìÅ Code Sources

### From AxiomPhoenix (`../_mono/AxiomPhoenix_v4_Split/`)
- **Components**: `/Components/ACO.*` files
- **Services**: `/Services/ASE.*` files
- **Base classes**: `/Base/ABA.*` files
- **Screens**: `/Screens/ASC.*` files

### From ALCAR (`../_mono/ALCAR_AXP/`)
- **Fast components**: `FastComponents/` directory
- **Project management**: `ProjectContext*.ps1` screens
- **String rendering**: Direct VT100 manipulation patterns

### Key Principles
1. **Speed First**: Always prefer cached string rendering over object allocation
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Only rebuild what changes
3. **Service Pattern**: Use DI for all cross-cutting concerns
4. **Component Reuse**: Build once, use everywhere
5. **Theme Consistency**: All colors through ThemeManager

### üéØ Input Handling Best Practices (Established 2025-07-22)

**For Screen Classes**:
```powershell
[bool] HandleInput([System.ConsoleKeyInfo]$key) {
    # 1. Handle screen-specific shortcuts FIRST (before children)
    switch ($key.Key) {
        ([System.ConsoleKey]::E) {
            if (-not $key.Modifiers -and ($key.KeyChar -eq 'E' -or $key.KeyChar -eq 'e')) {
                $this.EditItem()
                return $true
            }
        }
        # ... other shortcuts
    }
    
    # 2. Let base Screen handle navigation (Tab, etc.)
    if (([Screen]$this).HandleInput($key)) {
        return $true
    }
    
    # 3. Finally pass to focused children
    return ([Container]$this).HandleInput($key)
}
```

**For Container Components** (like TabContainer):
- Route input to logical content, not just direct children
- Use `activeTab.Content.HandleInput(key)` instead of `([Container]$this).HandleInput(key)`

**Debugging Input Issues**:
- Use logs: `grep -a "Key pressed: [KEY]" _Logs/praxis.log`
- Trace the routing path: MainScreen ‚Üí TabContainer ‚Üí Screen ‚Üí Container ‚Üí Child
- Verify HandleInput methods are actually being called
